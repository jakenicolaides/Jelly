### About
This is a simple resposive ui layout library for Jai. It has a few basic components like percentage sizing, buttons, simple text input fields. I use this for my own game development purposes but feel free to use and adapt if you find it useful for your projects.

### Compile and Run
jai-macos first.jai && ./jlay
