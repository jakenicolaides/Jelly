### About
This is a simple resposive imgui layout library for Jai. It has a few basic components like percentage sizing, buttons, simple text input fields. I use this for my own game development purposes but feel free to use and adapt if you find it useful for your projects. It only works/been tested on MacOS so far because that's what I use and obviously very much a work in progress. I intend to keep improving it as I build games using it. 

### Compile and Run
To build the example just run the metaprogram via
`jai-macos first.jai && ./jelly`
